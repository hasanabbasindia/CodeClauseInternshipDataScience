#  Stock-Market-Prediction   ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ

## Description

* In Stock Market Prediction project, I have attempted to implement a machine-learning  approach to predict stock prices(close). Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock prices. 
* The objective is to predict stock prices in order to make more informed and accurate investment decisions. We propose a stock price prediction system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other external factors for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades. 

* ``LSTMs`` are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. This is important in my case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price. While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, I have built a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down.
